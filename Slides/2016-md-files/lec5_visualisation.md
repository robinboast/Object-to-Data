	+ What is difference between illustration and visualisation?
+ Exploration vs. presentation

### Goal?

--

### Types of Visualisation

+ Galleries of images
+ Museums and collections of objects
+ Film, tv, moving images
+ Dramatic re-creations
+ Maps and atlases
+ Pictures of data
+ Single images

--

### Digital Visualisation

+ What’s difference between digital and non-digital visualisation?

--

### Digitality

+ Affordance of digital methods
	+ Digital visualisations can be interactive
    + zoom in, filter, rotate
    + [Characters in the Hobbit](http://nbilenko.com/projects/hobbit.html)
    + 3D reconstructed, first-person interactive worlds
    + [ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/)

--

### Seven Stages

1. Acquiring
2. Parsing
3. Filtering
4. Mining
5. **Representing**
6. **Refining**
7. **Interacting**

--

### Chicken or Egg?

+ Story should determine visualisation
+ But visualisation affects story
+ Recall two perspectives
    + exploration
    + presentation
+ non-linearity of steps
    + once you have story, choose visualisation

--

### Your Turn

+ Group assignment:
	+ Make visualisation for your project
	+ Think about story you want to tell
	+ Think about elements to visualise
+ Take 10 minutes to sketch one or more visualisations

--

### Data Types

+ Space
+ Quantitative data
+ Text
+ Time
+ 3D visualisation

--

### Combining Data Types

### Story in Visualisation

+ How much of the story is in visualisation?
    + all 7 steps contribute to story
    + to what extent do you need to know about steps leading up to visualisation?
    + [walking on the edge](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lounging%2Cstrolling%2Clurching%2Cdodging%2Cwaddling%2Ctrudging&year_start=1700&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clounging%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cstrolling%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Clurching%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdodging%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwaddling%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctrudging%3B%2Cc0)

--

### Visualisation Tools (1/2)

+ [Many Eyes](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/analytics/manyeyes/) by IBM
    + online, have to register
    + uploaded data becomes public data set
+ [Raw](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/) by DensityDesign Lab
    + online, data stays offline
    + open source on GitHub, can have local copy
+ [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/)
	+ commercial, free trial, offline & online

--

### Visualisation Tools (2/2)

+ Programmatic approach to visualisation
	+ [Vega](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/): online, open source, with editor
	+ [D3.js](http://d3js.org/): online & offline, open source

--

# Part 2: Fallacies in Visualisation

--

### Overview

+ Understanding Process
	+ where can errors/problems occur?
+ Understanding Experimentation
	+ how to detect errors/problems?

--

### Understanding Process

--

### Seven Steps

+ [visualization is tip of the iceberg](https://library.oreilly.com/book/9780596514556/visualizing-data/10.xhtml?ref=toc#process)
	1. acquiring
	2. parsing
	3. filtering
	4. mining
	5. representing
	6. refining
	7. interacting

--

### Fallacy of Irrelevance?

--

### Step 0: Asking Questions

“The most important part of understanding data is identifying the question that you want to answer. Rather than thinking about the data that was collected, think about how it will be used and work backward to what was collected.” (Fry, 2007)
+ What story should it tell?
	+ [The Brown Map](http://thebrownmap.nl/)

--

### Procedural Model 

+ Procedure for Visualization
	+ systematic way of thinking through process
	+ Helps one thinking about data, method and goal
+ Fallacies can occur in each step

--

### Step 1: Acquiring

+ Data criticism: what’s in, what’s missing
	+ [ePistolarium](http://ckcc.huygens.knaw.nl/epistolarium/), [Ecartico](http://www.vondel.humanities.uva.nl/ecartico/)
+ Data set may be contingent, incomplete, biased, ...
	+ ‘Visual sources present the viewer with a **complete, and convincing, picture** that is often derived from an **incomplete record** but the nature of the media used often **requires that the gaps be filled** during its creation and **thus concealed**.’ (Jessop, 2008, p.287)

--

### Step 2: Parsing

+ Preparation criticism: what’s impact of e.g. systematic errors
	+ Joanna Guldi studied [use of variants of ‘to walk’](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lounging%2Cstrolling%2Clurching%2Cdodging%2Cwaddling%2Ctrudging&year_start=1700&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clounging%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cstrolling%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Clurching%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdodging%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwaddling%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctrudging%3B%2Cc0)
	+ First occurrence of *Absolute Musik*
	+ [Recognition of names in novels](http://visualizer.namescape.nl/book/723)
+ Parsing procedure determines units of analysis

--

### Step 3: Filtering

+ Remove what is not needed
+ Remove until the key message jumps out
	+ but leave enough to understand/contextualise
	+ Visualization should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler
	+ [London Tube Map](images/tube-map.jpg)

--

### Step 3: Filtering

+ Remove what is not needed
+ Remove until the key message jumps out
	+ but leave enough to understand/contextualise
	+ Visualization should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler
	+ [London Tube Map](images/tube-map.jpg)
	+ Distortion can be useful!

--

### Step 4: Mining

+ Aggregate/summarise:
	+ show patterns of interest (mean, distribution, ...)
+ Don’t over-simplify
	+ e.g. show only mean while distribution is important
+ First observed pattern may not be most interesting
	+ timeline: aggregate per day/month/year/...
	+ [periodicity in newspaper topics](http://humanities.uva.nl/~mkoolen1/materials/Visualisation_Antwerp_2015/KB_topic_model_images.html)

--

### Step 5: Representing

+ Size of effect in data vs. size of effect in visualization
	+ what are units here: [NSW recruiting nurses](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/gallery/2013/aug/01/16-useless-infographics#img-3)
	+ and size of bubbles here: [Top 10 films by worldwide gross](http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/viz8.jpg)
+ Going against convention: [Gun deaths in Florida](http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/viz2.jpg) ([source](http://www.businessinsider.in/This-Chart-Shows-What-Happened-To-Gun-Deaths-In-Florida-After-Stand-Your-Ground-Was-Enacted/articleshow/30635752.cms))
+ Explain representation: provide legend, caption (explain units, scales, etc)
	+ [Narrative structure](http://nbilenko.com/projects/narrative.html)

--

### Step 6: Refining

+ Calling attention to particular data through color, hierarchy, zoom, ...
	+ typical ‘mistake’: [truncating axes](http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/viz3.jpg) ([source](http://www.businessinsider.in/We-Fixed-Fox-News-Embarrassing-Obamacare-Chart/articleshow/33034053.cms), [non-truncated version](http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/viz4.jpg))
	+ [Zoom can be misleading](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)
+ Focus should not hide relevant context

--

### Step 7: Interacting

+ Adding interaction allows exploring data
	+ New York Times [Guantanamo Docket](http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo)
	+ interactivity allows exploration of data and relations

--

### Non-Linear Process

--

### Understanding Experimentation

+ Joanna Guldi could have discovered the problem with *strolling* through experimenting
	+ try out different parameters, filters, representations
+ Each step (but especailly mining) involves many choices
	+ try multiple options, explore stability and validity of pattern

--

### Criticizing Visualizations

+ A beautiful fallacy in criticizing:
	+ [Adam Kirsch on the false promise of Digital Humanities](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch)
	+ Critized use of Google Ngram Viewer...
	+ ... and Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel’s [forgetting curve](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=1883%2C1910%2C1950&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=0&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C1883%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C1910%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C1950%3B%2Cc0)

### Criticizing Visualizations

+ If you criticize a visualization, at least look at it!

--

### Wrap Up

+ Understanding process helps avoiding and locating mistakes
	+ 7-step process
	+ but think about the *why*
+ Experiment and consider alternatives at each step
	+ criticize your decisions
